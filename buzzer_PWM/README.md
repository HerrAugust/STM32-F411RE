This example shows how to use Timers in PWM (Pulse width modulation) mode to control the intensity of a buzzer.

In particular, this example raises its intensity for 10 seconds, than a decrease follows for 10 seconds and so on.

On STM32 F411RE, connect the buzzer to GND and to D12; connect a transciever to D12 and D2. The attached figure shows it too.
